This project is a quiz app built with React. The app features a single component called "Question", which displays a series of multiple-choice questions to the user. The questions are stored in an array of objects, each containing an id, a question prompt, and an array of options. Each option has an id, a text value, and a boolean flag indicating whether it is the correct answer.

The app uses React's useState hook to manage the current question being displayed and the user's score. When the user selects an answer, the app checks whether it is correct and updates the score accordingly. The app also tracks the user's progress through the quiz and displays a final score at the end.

The app is styled with CSS and uses standard React files such as index.js and app.js.
